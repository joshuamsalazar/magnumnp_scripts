# Configuration files

## Terminator

I use this layout of Terminator windows to run simulations and surf through the files within the folders of my simulation data. 

## Byobu

Very useful tool for keeping alive terminal sessions within ssh connections, also it is a very practical terminal feature (although I prefer Terminator in my local machine)
