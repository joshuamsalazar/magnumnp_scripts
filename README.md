# magnumnp_scripts
Space to write and archive my ultimate scripts for some automated tasks and simulations commonly done through magnumnp. 

I served as a personal backup code site, where I share my config files of miscellaneous tools I used for simulating. 

You can reuse the scripts here and suggest modifications to them. 

Happy coding and siimulation!
