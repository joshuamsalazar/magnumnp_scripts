# magnumnp_scripts
Space to write and archive my ultimate scripts for some automated tasks and micromagnetic simulations commonly done through [magnumnp](https://pypi.org/project/magnumnp/). 

I served as a personal backup code site, where I share my config files of miscellaneous tools I used for simulating. 

## Folders 
The folders in this repository are described as follows:

### config_files
Here files for recovering custom settings for some helper programs usually used for performing the simulations. They are not mainly needed, but provide some features that may save you some time. ;)

### [File handlers/xclean](./file_handlers/xclean/README.md)
Managing your files. _xclean_ cleans `.vti` files keeping just the last simulated state.

### [h_ext_sweeps](https://github.com/joshuamsalazar/magnumnp_scripts/tree/main/h_ext-sweeps/xsweep)
Scripts for performing and visualizing external field sweeps.

### [Screenshot auto-generation](./paraview/xscreenshot/README.md)
Auto generate screenshots with custom configurations from Paraview.

## P.D.

You can reuse the scripts here and suggest modifications to them. 

Happy coding and siimulation!
